/* sorting classifies based on
1 time complexity 
2 space complexity some take constant memory(in place) some take extra space(usage depends on no of input size n) exaple nerge sort alfo to stroe the array
3 stability
(equality of the key )property on which we are sorting preserves the  relative order of element
so if the key is equal and the element is coming before in the original list then in sorted list also the
elemnt should come before stability guarantees that
4 external sort(data in disk / tapes etc) internal sort(data is in ram only)
5 non recursive(insertion sort selection sort) or recursive(merge sort  quick sort)*/
